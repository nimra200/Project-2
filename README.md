# Project-2
 
To demonstrate our understanding of logic programming, we worked on a spreadsheet software in Racket with [miniKanren](http://minikanren.org/). 
This project consists of a static type inferencer and checker for a spreadsheet language. The purpose was to check whether
the values in a given spreadsheet have the correct types.
